# Get with the times

**Slang**, 

To understand or be knowledgeable of modern times, especially as relates to the contemporary trends, ideas, or fashions. (Usually said as a jocular or sarcastic imperative.)

**Example**

If you're not already using a rest client such as Insomnia or Postman, get with the times!
